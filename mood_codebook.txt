Mood data has been collected via iMoodJournal android app from Sept 5, 2015 onward.
Data has been exported directly from the app to iMoodJournal.csv.

Mood is recorded on an arbitrary scale from 1 to 10 with 1 being worst and 10 being 
best. Data recording include choosing a mood level number and, optionally, including
a picutre and/or text comment. Text comments support the use of hashtags (#) to easily
search for specific triggers or events that might be related to mood. I have used these
primarily to mark start/stop/dose change dates for my medication with the #wellbutrin tag.
